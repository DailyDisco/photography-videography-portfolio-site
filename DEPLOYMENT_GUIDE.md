4. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile and start building

### Step 3: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click "New Service"
2. Select "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, go to your service â†’ Variables and add:

```bash
# Required Variables
